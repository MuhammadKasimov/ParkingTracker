# Car Parking Management System

Welcome to the Car Parking Management System repository! This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for managing parking lots, tracking cars' entry and exit times, and generating receipts based on the duration of stay.

## Features

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**: The system is capable of automatically capturing the number plate of vehicles upon entry and exit.
- **Entry and Exit Logging**: Records the time of entry and exit for each vehicle.
- **Receipt Generation**: Generates a receipt for each vehicle based on the duration of stay and a constant price per hour.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface.

# Night time Camera Issue
One significant challenge faced by our system is the nighttime camera issue, particularly when lighting conditions change and nearby standing cars affect tracking. Here are some strategies to address this issue:

- Proper Lighting: Ensure proper lighting around the parking area for consistent image quality. Adequate lighting can help improve the camera's performance, especially during nighttime operations.

- Camera Settings Adjustment: Experiment with camera settings such as exposure, sensitivity, and white balance to optimize performance in low-light conditions. Adjusting these settings can help mitigate tracking issues caused by changes in lighting.
